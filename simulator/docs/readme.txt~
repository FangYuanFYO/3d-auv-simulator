Project Name: 3d-auv-simulator

Pre-requisites:
The following should be installed before running the simulator:
Panda3d 1.8.1
PyQt4
Python

Steps to run the simulator:
Download the simulator folder. Then in the terminal type the following commands:

# cd simulator
# python main.py

To add a new model:
1. Click on Browse button (or press 'Ctrl + b' for Windows). Select the .egg model file and click Open. Some sample models have been added to the assets folder. To add the panda model, just type models/panda in the model field.
2. Click on the 'Add Model' button. This would add the model to the scene.

To adjust the size and position of the model, change the respective fields like X:,Y:,Scale, etc. and click on the corresponding buttons. 

Note: The size and scale are adjusted for the latest model that was added. Adding a new model to the scene would take the control to the new model, thus not allowing us to change the previous models.
I am adding the option to choose the model from a list of added models so that the position of any model can be changed at any time.

TODO:
Add a save option to save the current state of the simulator which can be loaded later on.
